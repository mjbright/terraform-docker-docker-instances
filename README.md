# Module terraform-docker-instances

Module: To create a group of Docker instances, potentially mimicking VMs (see examples/mjbright.ubuntu-sshd)

**Note:** This is not intended to be a practical use of Terraform for managing Docker containers.  The purpose is to be able to quickly create/destroy artifacts for the purpose of learning Terraform concepts
